PlyWin is a reduced version of [MeshLab](http://www.meshlab.net/), which aims at only 3D model viewing. Besides, it can also be used to observe and check the component detection results of [PCFit](https://github.com/weiquanmao/PCF), which is the main intention of developing this project.

## Requirements

+ [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) (our version is msvc2015_5.6.1)
+ [VCG Library](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/vcglib/) (embeded)
